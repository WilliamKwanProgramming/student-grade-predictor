# Student Performance Indicator

### Dataset Details

This project investigates how factors such as parental background, test preparation, and other variables influence students' performance on math exams.

The dataset includes eight features:

- `gender`: The student’s sex (Male/Female)
- `race/ethnicity`: The student’s ethnic group (A, B, C, D, or E)
- `parental level of education`: The highest level of education achieved by the student’s parent(s) (e.g., high school, associate’s degree, bachelor’s degree, master’s degree)
- `lunch`: Type of lunch provided (standard or free/reduced)
- `test preparation course`: Whether the student completed a prep course before the exam (yes/no)
- `reading score`: The score the student received on the reading section
- `writing score`: The score the student received on the writing section

**Target variable:**

- `math score`: The student’s score on the math exam.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Ingestion**

   - Load the data from the CSV file.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets and save each as a separate CSV.

2. **Data Transformation**

   - Build a `ColumnTransformer` pipeline:
     - **Numeric features:** Fill missing values with the median (to handle outliers) and apply standard scaling.
     - **Categorical features:** Fill missing values with the most frequent category, perform one-hot encoding, then apply standard scaling.
   - Save the fitted transformer as a `.pkl` file in the `artifacts` folder.

3. **Model Training**

   - Train several regression models and evaluate their performance.
   - Identify Linear Regression as the best model, then perform hyperparameter tuning.
   - Serialize the final model to a pickle file for use in the prediction pipeline.

4. **Prediction Pipeline**

   - Accept new input data, convert it into a DataFrame, load the necessary pickle files (transformer and model), and output the predicted math score.

5. **Flask Web App**

   - Create a Flask application with a user interface that allows users to enter feature values and receive a predicted math score in their browser.
